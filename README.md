Become the hero for someone or ask for help - REST API made with Node.js
</p>

ðŸ†˜ About BeTheHero
------------------
This project is a software that allows organizations to ask for help and share their necessities. The software has a [**web version**](https://github.com/riltonfranzonee/bethehero) made with ReactJS, where the organizations are able to create new incidents and manage them by deleting. The application also has a [**mobile version**](https://github.com/riltonfranzonee/bethero-mobile) made with React Native, where anyone can access to know about the incidents and contact organizations to become a hero. All this software is served by a [**REST API**](https://github.com/riltonfranzonee/bethehero-api) made with Node.js

:wrench: Used technologies:
----------------------
This RESTful API works with SQLite and to help me build the queries I used knex. Here is a list of technologies I used to develop this api:

- [**Insomnia**](https://insomnia.rest/)
- [**NodeJS**](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [**ExpressJS**](https://expressjs.com/)
- [**Nodemon**](https://nodemon.io/)
- [**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- [**Knex**](http://knexjs.org/)
- [**Yup**](https://github.com/jquense/yup)
- [**Jest**](https://editorconfig.org/)
- [**Eslint**](https://eslint.org/)
- [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/)
- [**EditorConfig**](https://editorconfig.org/)
